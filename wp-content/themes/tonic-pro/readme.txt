== ABOUT TONIC PRO ==

Create a truly unique design with Tonic Pro, a lightweight and fully responsive HTML5 theme based on the Gridiculous boilerplate. Use the new Theme Options customizer to add own header image, custom background, page layout, site width and more. Distinguish each post with one of the eight supported post formats, such as: Video, Image, Aside, Status, Audio, Quote, Link and Gallery. Install JetPack to display each of your galleries through a tiled view and jQuery carousel. Compatible with bbPress & BuddyPress. Built using SASS, Compass and Twitter Bootstrap. Includes 20 Google Fonts for improved typeface readability and works perfectly in desktop browsers, tablets and handheld devices. For a live demo go to http://demos.bavotasan.com/tonic-pro/.

== NOTES ==

* Due to the design of the header, your site name and description should not be too long or else they will knock other elements out of place and cause the carousel to fall below the image. The font you select will also determine how long your site name and description are so please test out different fonts.
* The default size required for the header image is 1500px by 550px.
* If you have a drop down list for your site navigation, the parent item should only be a grouping title with a "#" value for the HREF parameter. The Bootstrap navbar requires a click to open the drop down list so any link that is set in the parent item will not work.
* The four boxes on the home page are created by adding the Image Text Widget to the Home Page Top Area.
